<text>A dream doesn't become reality through magic, it takes sweat determination and hard work</text>
<text>If it doesn't challenge you, it doesn't change you</text>
<text>One workout at a time, one day at a time</text>
<text>Wake up with determination, go to bed with satisfaction</text>
<text>What seems impossible today will one day become your warm up</text>
<text>Train like a beast, look like a beauty</text>
<text>Get fit now, you deserve it. Decide. Commit. Succeed.</text>
<text>Good things come to those who sweat</text>
<text>Better sore than sorry</text>
<text>Every workout counts</text>
<text>When you think about quitting, think about why you started</text>
<text>A 1 hour workout is only 4% of your day</text>
<text>When you lose your excuses, you'll find results</text>
<text>If it's important to you, you'll find a way</text>
<text>Be stronger than your excuses</text>
<text>Excuses don't burn calories</text>
<text>Your only limit is you</text>
<text>Stop wishing and start doing</text>
<text>Don't use the weekend as an excuse to give up on your goals</text>
<text>Don't wish for a good body, work for it</text>
<text>A healthy outside starts from the inside</text>
<text>It's not always easy, but it's always worth it</text>
<text>If you are persistent you will get it, if you are consistent you will keep it</text>
